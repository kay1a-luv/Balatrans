## Art and Design

All Jokers were drawn and designed by... me! <br>
The Pride jokers are based off the original Jokers from the original Balatro game. <br>

## Programming

The template codebase for this mod was taken from [eclipsedsunrise](https://github.com/eclipsedsunrise/ClipsJokers/releases). <br>

This was all coded by me, Kay1a!

Please assume all the bad code is mine. This is my first time coding in Lua, and I'm still learning. <br>

## Special Thanks

[EclipsedSunrise](https://github.com/eclipsedsunrise/ClipsJokers/releases) who has provided me a template of sorts for making this mod!  <br>

[Roffle](https://www.twitch.tv/roffle) who continues to make amazing content that gets me further and further into the game. I wouldn't have attempted this mod if I hadn't got hooked on the game. <br>

[Bean](https://www.youtube.com/@Bean_77) whose content got me into downloading mods and continues to inspire me to get better at the game. I really want to try multiplayer, but I'm waiting to get all the stakes! <br>

**LocalThunk**, obviously. Thanks for making the game! <br>

Everyone who contributed to the SMODS Github Wiki. This mod would not have been possible without your documentation. <br>

And you, hopefully, for playing!
